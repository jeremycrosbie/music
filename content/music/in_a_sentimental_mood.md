+++

Written by Duke Ellington in 1935, _In a Sentimental Mood_ was originally written and recorded for Duke Ellington's orchestra, but here it is arranged and performed by me on solo guitar.  It has been recorded many times, but if I had to pick my favorite version, it would be from the 1962 album _Duke Ellington & John Coltrane_.
