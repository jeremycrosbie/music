I first heard this tune on Earl Klugh's 2005 album _Naked Guitar_.  I instantly wanted to learn this tune and figure out a way to come up with an arrangement as beautiful as Mr. Klugh.  I don't know if I accomplished that goal, but I love playing this tune and figuring out new ways of approaching it.
